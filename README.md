Our submission for the [GMTK Game jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022), made over two days with a lot of crunch,

Dino Dice-aster, a game about a small dino with his head stuck in a dice, where the roll of said dice fills in levels with new pieces!

Made in Unity using C#, With art sourced from [Arks](https://arks.itch.io/dino-characters) and [AnalogStudios](https://analogstudios.itch.io/four-seasons-platformer-tileset)
